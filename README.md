# Purpose
This is a script to fix Apple's media controls when using external audio devices that supposedly don't support controlling the volume, but in practice are able to. If you are able to control the volume of a device through System Preferences --> Sound, but the volume keys don't work, then this is the fix.

# Directions
1. Clone this repo to ~/bin/
2. Follow the directions inside of `extras` to connect this to Karabiner Elements (a tool to do hotkey overrides)
